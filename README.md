# **Ezra's Money Machine 🚀**

**A Financial Literacy App for Kids** *Built by Taitt Fin*

Ezra's Money Machine is an interactive web application designed to teach 6-year-olds the power of compound interest using concrete visualization techniques.

## **🌟 Features**

* **The Coin Rules Infographic:** Translates abstract interest rates into tangible coins (1% \= Penny, 25% \= Quarter).  
* **The Time Machine Slider:** An interactive slider that lets Ezra age his money from 6 to 18 years old.  
* **Visual Compound Growth:** "Rocket Money" (Roth IRA) grows visibly faster than "Sleeping Money" (Checking).  
* **Mobile First:** Designed to look and feel like a native app on iPads and iPhones.

## **🛠️ How it Works**

The app is built as a **Single File React Application**. It requires no build steps, no backend, and no complex servers. It uses:

* React 18 (via CDN)  
* Tailwind CSS (via CDN)  
* Babel Standalone (for in-browser compilation)
